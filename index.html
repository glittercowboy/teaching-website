            <h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>
            
            <div class="problem-content">
                <p>Most aspiring artists focus solely on acquiring technical knowhow, unconsciously treating music as an intellectual exercise rather than a soulful art form.</p>
                
                <p>They binge-watch tutorials, stock-piling knowledge as they seek the <em>perfect</em> piece of information before they can truly get started. They can't help but buy whatever shiny new piece of gear an ad promises to give them a fleeting feeling of inspiration.</p>
                
                <p>When they're not being "consumers", they are being mere "<em>producers</em>"; robotic technicians who copy others and follow trends but struggle to create original and meaningful music themselves.</p>
                
                <h5 class="highlight-text">Instead of empowered artists, <br>they become disempowered "content creators".</h5>
                
                <p>You see, while some amount of technical skills <em>are</em> necessary to produce quality music, they alone don't create art that has the power to truly move people.</p>
                
                <p>Empowered artists - the kind capable of deeply affecting listeners and creating real change in the world - know that their power does not come from filling the mind with techniques, but from using one's heart to amplify their passion and emotions.</p>
                
                <p>Great art is not forcibly made. It appears - as if by magic - when you allow your heart to guide your creative process.</p>
                
                <h5 class="highlight-text">This is the <em>only</em> way technique can be used <br>to create something <strong>extraordinary</strong>.</h5>

                        <p>"Working with TÂCHES has been transformative. He's truly gifted - you just know when you find a great teacher. His techniques are all centered around delivering freedom - freedom from perfectionism, self-criticism, and all the mental blocks we face as artists. After eight years of producing, I'd reached a point where I'd lost the joy in making music. TÂCHES helped me get past the over-seriousness of it all and reconnect with what matters. He shows you how to make music that genuinely comes from within, which is incredibly satisfying. The breakthroughs have been amazing on every level. His guidance helps you move away from thoughts like 'Will people like this?' and back to authentic artistic expression. TÂCHES is a uniquely gifted teacher and human being - I can't recommend working with him highly enough."</p>
